# Take a look at my amazing Data Science portfolio

## Work Experience
I have more than 4 years experience working with data. It's my favourite thing in the world. I have an immense curiosity in anything data based (get it?) and can't wait to get started on working with you.

## Education
I have completed the level 4 Data Analysis apprenticeship and have recently started the level 6 Data Science apprenticeship, which I'm really enjoying.

## Experience
I have worked within the Marketing Department of a [global process engineering company](https://www.uk.endress.com/en)  for 25 years. During this time, I've become proficient at Excel, learnt more about SAP than you've had hot dinners and dabbled with SAP Analytics Cloud. I'm finding my feet with Python and admit I've stil a long way to go!

## Interests
Amongst my many interests I enjoy gaming (especially Cricket with my son), playing cricket at a very amateurish level and cooking.

## Horizon scanning
Below is a brief summary in how I stay up-to-date on all things Data Science.

## Projects
Examples of the projects that I've completed can be found below. Take a look and find more about how I can help you.

### Project no. 1
**Title** An analysis of a historical video game data

![Video Game Sales Visualisation](assests/2025_video_games_1.jpg)
*Figure: Global video game sales trends visualised from the dataset.*

**Introduction** Using Python and a freely available public data, the aim of this project was to identify trends and predict sales.

**Dataset** The dataset contained over 64,000 rows and had twelve columns containing things such as genre and sales. There was a large amount of data that needed rectifying - who hasn't had that problem before?



**Analysis** A breakdown of the analysis performed with visualisations and explanations

**Modelling** An explanation of the modelling techniques used such as supervised/unsupervised learning and predictive analytics

**Results** An outline of the results and the insights uncovered.

**Conclusion** A summary of the project and its findings
