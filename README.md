# Take a look at my amazing Data Science portfolio

## Work Experience
I have more than 3 years experience working with data. It's my favourite thing in the world. I have an immense curiosity on anything data based and can't wait to get started on working with you.

## Education
I have completed the level 4 Data Analysis apprenticeship and have recently started the level 6 Data Science apprenticeship which I'm really enjoying.

## Experience
I have worked within the Marketing Department of a [global process engineering company](https://www.uk.endress.com/en)  for 25 years. During this time I've become an proficient at Excel, learnt more about SAP than you've had hot dinners and dabbled with Analytics Cloud.

## Interests
Amongst my many interests I enjoy gaming (especially Cricket with my son), playing cricket at a very amateurish level and cooking.
